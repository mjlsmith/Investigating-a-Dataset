P2Data Analyst Nanodegree Program
Project Submission 
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings. Evaluation Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working! Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" or "exceed specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass. 
Submission 
What to include in your submission
1.	A PDF or HTML file containing your analysis. This file should include:
2.	A note specifying which dataset you analyzed
3.	A statement of the question(s) you posed
4.	A description of what you did to investigate those questions
5.	Documentation of any data wrangling you did
6.	Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results
7.	Code you used to perform your analysis. If you used an Jupyter notebook, you can submit your .ipynb. Otherwise, you should submit the code separately in .py file(s).
8.	A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources). 
Jupyter notebook instructions 
If you used Jupyter notebook to create your analysis, you can include your code directly in the notebook and do not need to create additional files to submit it separately. You will still need to export your work in a standalone format (see point 1 above). To download your notebook as an HTML file, click on File -> Download.As -> HTML (.html) within the notebook. If you get an error about "No module name", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using pip install <module_name> (don't include the "<" or ">" or any words following a period in the module name).
